# FirstMate domain foundation

FirstMate organizes durable work without replacing the existing orchestration
state. A workspace is scoped to one project, topics link to existing threads,
and decisions reference provider-agnostic user-input, approval, or FirstMate
sources.

The contract and pure domain functions live in `packages/contracts` and
`packages/shared`. Commands are validated before the decider emits typed facts;
the projector reconstructs workspace state by replaying those facts. This is the
foundation for storing them in the existing orchestration event log. It must not
grow into a separate event store.

## Persistent facts versus derived state

Topic title, summary, stage, delegation, linked thread, and decision lifecycle
are persistent facts. Operational status is a read-model concern. It is derived
from the topic stage plus the linked thread's session, pending user input,
approvals, background liveness, and delivery status.

The derivation prioritizes a user decision, then an operator-owned delivery
gate, then execution failure and background liveness. A completed topic can
therefore correctly appear as `waiting-deploy` or `monitoring` without changing
the provider session lifecycle or implying that a deployment happened.

Machine alerts are aggregate read facts. They can be shown next to a topic, but
they never restart a service, clean a disk, signal a process, or otherwise
perform remediation.

## Next integration boundary

The server will wrap accepted FirstMate facts in the existing orchestration
event envelope and persist them transactionally with command receipts and
projections. Clients will consume projected topic summaries; they will not replay
an independent client-side history.
